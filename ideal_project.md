This post is about my ideal project. To get the big picture, please read the Abstract. This is a WIP.


# Abstract

- I believe ["the People factor"](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Agile%2Bdevelopment%253A%2Bthe%2Bpeople%2Bfactor) (Allistair cockburn) is the most important success factor for a given project.
- Ethics really matter to me. What I do with computers must be worth doing:)
- Agile practices - programming techniques & project managements tools - are key ingredients to succeed
- Technologies. I am an early adopter and I fell in ♥ with ruby 6 years ago. I am still in. 

# People

In an ideal project, what matters most to me is the *Team*. We don't have that many opportunities to choose our colleagues. It's a shame.

A team composed of smart and hard-working people is not enough. 

*Trust* is essential. Trust is a big time saver:)

[Non Violent Communication]( http://www.wikihow.com/Practice-Nonviolent-Communication ) can be a good way. I am fed up with slang people use to talk to each other and the immaturity of jokes about minorities.

As an Agile coach, I insist a lot on retrospectives. Conflict is part of life. People in the team should work together and dare to express constructive critics to their pairs and managers.

## Direct communication

!["alt"](http://www.qualitystreet.fr/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/communicationmodes-ambler1.png)

I prefer face to face (physically or skype) communication. [e-mail bankruptcy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_bankruptcy) is a modern plague. I don't believe campfire is an efficient way of communicating. It's fun and good for team building though. 

## Remote

I live in Lyon, which hasn't got many interesting ruby gigs for now. So, I am willing to work remotely in order to find a job which will make me happy:) I want to use skype with video as much as possible as I did when working for [Betterplace](http://betterplace.org). And obviously as much face to face meetings as possible.

# Ethics

A quote from Weinberg G.M.'s book ["Psychology of computer programming"](http://www.amazon.com/The-Psychology-Computer-Programming-Anniversary/dp/0932633420), written in 1970:

> Is what we are doing with computers worth doing? Because computers are such fascinating beasts, because programming is such a game, such a joy, we who program computers are in danger of becoming the unwitting pawns of those who would use our toys for not-so-playful ends. Can there be any doubt that if Hitler had computers at his command, one of the first application would have been keeping closer track on Jews and Gypsies so that all who should have gone to the ovens did go to the ovens? Can there be any doubt that somewhere in our country today some human beings are using computers as just another, finer weapon in their arsenal of ways to subjugate other human beings to their wishes—to their conception of the proper life of man?

I won't work for these industries: 

- nuclear
- non ethical banks
- polluters
- weapons
- any company related to a dictature
- ...

Sectors which make me happy to wake up every morning:

- Ethical banks, e.g.: [Triodos](http://www.triodos.com/)
- NGOs
- Renewable energies
- Health
